# Site Voice Guide

## Goal
Write like a sharp engineer talking to another human, not a marketing team.

## Tone
- Friendly, direct, and a little playful.
- Credible through specifics, not buzzwords.
- Calm confidence: explain tradeoffs without hype.

## What To Do
- Prefer first-person voice for experience-based claims.
- Use concrete language: tools, outcomes, failures, fixes.
- Keep sentences tight and conversational.
- Add light personality when it helps clarity.

## What To Avoid
- Corporate filler like "leverage," "world-class," or "synergy."
- Vague claims with no evidence.
- Over-polished copy that hides uncertainty.
- Forced jokes or slang that weaken trust.

## Quick Style Checks
- Can this line be said out loud without sounding scripted?
- Does each section include at least one concrete detail?
- Would a peer engineer trust this after one read?
