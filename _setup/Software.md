# Software

This is a big topic. If you would rather simply dive into my config, I store ALL of my environment config, installed apps, etc etc... in my [Github Dotfiles](https://github.com/techdufus/dotfiles). There you will find a lot of documentation around how I'm configuring my environment, as well as the actual config itself.

Just seeing my config doesn't really bode will with understanding contextually 'how' I work, just what's installed. I hope to paint a picture with this section with a high-level workflow with my core tools, and most used tools that I have.
