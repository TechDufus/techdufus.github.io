# Setup

Welcome to my setup! Here you **should** find everything there is to know about my setup. This includes my home office gear, how everything is plugged in between my machines, my homelab / home network hardware, as well as my typical workflow with tools, configs, etc etc... Obviously workflow side can change rapidly, but I will try to keep this document as up to date as possible, with links to all my config source code.

Enjoy! 🎉
