# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Jekyll-based personal blog and portfolio website for TechDufus, hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is built using the personal-jekyll-theme and includes sections for blog posts, timeline, setup documentation, and contact information.

## Development Commands

### Local Development
- `./scripts/install` - Install Jekyll and dependencies
- `./scripts/serve` - Build and serve for development (dev config, no analytics/comments)
- `./scripts/serve-production` - Build and serve with production config at 127.0.0.1:4000
- `./scripts/serve-lan` - Serve across LAN (development config)
- `./scripts/serve-lan-production` - Serve across LAN (production config)

### Docker Development
- `docker-compose up` - Run Jekyll in Docker container
- `docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v "$PWD:/srv/jekyll" jekyll/jekyll jekyll serve --watch --host "0.0.0.0" --config _config.yml,_config.dev.yml`

### GitHub Actions Deployment
- Uses custom workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Automatically deploys on push to master branch
- Can manually trigger via Actions tab or: `gh workflow run deploy.yml`

### Content Management
- `./scripts/newpost <title>` - Create new blog post in _posts/ directory
- `./scripts/generate-categories` - Generate category pages for blog posts
- `./scripts/generate-tags` - Generate tag pages for blog posts
- `./scripts/Add-BlogPostFromQueue.ps1` - PowerShell script to process blog post queue

### Maintenance
- `./scripts/integrate-personal` - Integrate latest updates from upstream theme

## Architecture

### Configuration
- `_config.yml` - Main Jekyll configuration for production
- `_config.dev.yml` - Development overrides (used with serve script)
- Uses Jekyll collections for the setup section with defined ordering

### Content Structure
- `_posts/` - Blog posts in markdown format with YAML frontmatter
- `_setup/` - Setup documentation as Jekyll collection (Hardware, Software, Homelab)
- `_layouts/` - Jekyll layout templates
- `_includes/` - Reusable Jekyll components and partials
- `_sass/` - SCSS stylesheets

### Key Features
- Dynamic typing animation on header with configurable quotes
- Timeline section with events and images
- Social media integration and sharing buttons
- Disqus comments integration
- Google Analytics tracking
- Web app mode with custom icons
- Gesture navigation for mobile

### Styling
- Uses SCSS with compression enabled in production
- FontAwesome icons for social media and UI elements
- Custom timeline and grayscale themes

### Dependencies
- Jekyll with webrick, jekyll-paginate, and jemoji plugins
- Docker support for containerized development (may have platform compatibility issues on ARM64)

## Troubleshooting

### Docker/Podman Issues
If encountering platform compatibility issues (ARM64 vs x86_64) or protobuf errors:
1. Use native Jekyll installation with `./scripts/serve`
2. For Docker issues, the provided docker-compose.yml uses Ruby Alpine with build tools
3. SCSS compilation errors may occur due to sass-embedded compatibility - consider using sassc gem instead

### Sass Deprecation Warnings
The site uses older Sass syntax that generates deprecation warnings but doesn't break functionality:
- `@import` statements should be updated to `@use`
- `darken()` function calls should use `color.adjust()` instead
- Mixed declaration order in CSS rules
These are warnings only - the site builds and runs correctly.

## Recent Optimizations Applied

- Fixed Bootstrap version consistency (3.4.1 for both CSS and JS)

### Analytics & Tracking
- Migrated from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4 (GA4)

### Native Development
Preferred approach for development:
```bash
./scripts/install  # Install dependencies (may need sudo/admin rights)
./scripts/serve     # Development server
./scripts/serve-production  # Production server
```
