## Monitors {#hardware-monitors}

- [Dell 49" 120hz CRG9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/)
- VioTek 27" Curved
- [HP P224 21.5" 60hz](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/product-specs/hp-p224-21.5-inch-monitor/26575345)

I have 3 monitors currently, But I am actually only using the CRG9 at the moment. This helps me stay more focussed. Though it is annoying never being able to share my whole screen on meetings since it's so huge, I am forced to switch between sharing individual apps.


## Peripherals {#hardware-peripherals}

### Keyboard {#hardware-keyboard}

I currently rock the [ZSA Moonlander MRK I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) and LOVE it. I use a custom [DVORAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) keyboard layout.

ZSA comes with their [ORYX](https://configure.zsa.io/home) layout editor, which I use create my [configuration](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/j6X5Z/latest/0) for my layout.

There is a lot about my keyboard config that lends itself to my workflow tooling like [hammerspoon/gridlayout] for my window manager (f13 and f16 keys).

### Mouse {#hardware-mouse}

I use the [Logitech MX Master3](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/mice/mx-master-3s.html) and have for about 3 years now. Every now and then the horizontal scroll doesn't seem to want to work right, but with my workflow becoming more and more mouse-independent, I could probably use any mouse since I rarely reach for it.
