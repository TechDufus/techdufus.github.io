### Sherlock {#hardware-sherlock}

Sherlock is what I call my personal Desktop PC. It's a custom-built PC running dual-boot Windows 11 / some flavor of linux.

### M3 MacBook Pro - Nov 2023 {#hardware-m3macbook}

This is the [M3 MacBook Pro (14-inch, M3, Nov 2023)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/117735).

### Intel MacBook Pro - Mid 2015

This is the [Intel MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, Mid 2015)](https://support.apple.com/en-us/111955).

## Monitors {#hardware-monitors}

I have 3 monitors currently, But I am actually only using the [CRG9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/) at the moment. This helps me stay more focussed. Though it is annoying never being able to share my whole screen on meetings since it's so huge, I am forced to switch between sharing individual apps.

- [Samsung 49" 120hz CRG9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/) [5120x1440p]
- VioTek 27" Curved [1920x1080p]
- [HP P224 21.5" 60hz](https://support.hp.com/us-en/product/product-specs/hp-p224-21.5-inch-monitor/26575345) [1920x1080p]

I've always wanted to try a single 4k or 5k display with a normal aspect ratio (not super-ultrawide), but being on MacOS and having my current window manager (Hammerspoon/GridLayout) I am really settling into this [CRG9](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/monitors/gaming/49-crg9-dual-qhd-curved-qled-gaming-monitor-lc49rg90ssnxza/)


## Peripherals {#hardware-peripherals}

### Microphone {#hardware-microphone}

I just received the [Rode NT-USB+ Microphone](https://rode.com/en-us/microphones/usb/nt-usb-plus) and I sure love it. I used to use the [Logitech Yeti X](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-x-professional-microphone.988-000105.html), but after a few years it lost it's luster, and for good reason.

The [Logitech Yeti X](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/streaming-gear/yeti-x-professional-microphone.988-000105.html) requires the [Logitech G HUB](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/innovation/g-hub.html) program running for anything magical to happen. All digital processing is done via the G HUB application. On top of this, there is no settings sync between computers, which means I've always had to install G HUB on each computer, tweak EVERY LITTLE SETTING to hopefully get things to match between computers. It was just a hastle...

With the [Rode NT-USB+ Microphone](https://rode.com/en-us/microphones/usb/nt-usb-plus), ALL processing happens within the mic. That means I have all my mic settings and functions no matter what device I plug it into, and does not require a running program on the computer either.

### Keyboard {#hardware-keyboard}

I currently rock the [ZSA Moonlander MRK I](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander) and LOVE it. I use a custom [DVORAK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_keyboard_layout) keyboard layout.

ZSA comes with their [ORYX](https://configure.zsa.io/home) layout editor, which I use create my [configuration](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/j6X5Z/latest/0) for my layout.

There is a lot about my keyboard config that lends itself to my workflow tooling like [hammerspoon/gridlayout] for my window manager (f13 and f16 keys).

Originally I wanted to buy the [Kenesis Advantage360 Professional](https://kinesis-ergo.com/shop/adv360pro/) but it was sold out at the time and I didn't want to wait, so I went with the Moonlander. I'm VERY happy with the Moonlander, but if I needed to buy another keyboard I'd be torn between the two, Unless ZSA comes out with a MRK II that fixes some of my issues with the Moonlander, then it'd be a no-brainer for me.

Than brings me to....

#### Keyboard Issues

I do have some issues with the Moonlander as it is.

1. Portability. Why am I required to use an alan wrench in order to loosen / collapse the thumb clusters in order to store the keyboard in it's travel case?
2. I wish the Moonlander was able to tent more with the stock configuration. I know this is probably a hard problem to solve, but 3D printing your own custom tent kit is just not an option for everyone. I think there's a place where you can buy a nice metal tent kit, but it seems bulky and doesn't lent itself to my first issue above in regards to being portable.

### Mouse {#hardware-mouse}

I use the [Logitech MX Master3]() and have for about 3 years now. Every now and then the horizontal scroll doesn't seem to want to work right, but with my workflow becoming more and more mouse-independent, I could probably use any mouse since I rarely reach for it.

### Webcam {#hardware-webcam}

I currently have 2 webcams. One is my main one, and the other I have that I used to play with extra OBS scenes / angles for streaming.

- [Logitech C925E Business](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c925e-business-webcam.960-001075.html)
- [Logitech C922 Pro](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/products/webcams/c922-pro-stream-webcam.html)

Both of these cameras are okay. I would only consider upgrading if I wanted something that was 1080p 60hz or better.

### Speakers {#hardware-speakers}

I have used the [Creative T100 Speakers](https://us.creative.com/p/speakers/creative-t100) for a few years now and they have some pretty stellar sound. No complaints here.

### Headphones {#hardware-headphones}

I use the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://electronics.sony.com/audio/headphones/headband/p/wh1000xm5-b)'s. I'm a big fan of noise cancelling headphones since my office is pretty noisy. The room next-door is our HVAC, I have a portable A/C unit, [walking pad](https://www.urevo.com/products/spacewalk-3s-treadmill), air purifier, and children all make a lot of noise which necessitates noise-cancelling vs. open-ear style headphones.

My last pair that I used for YEARS was the [Bose QuietComfort 35 II](https://global.bose.com/content/consumer_electronics/b2c_catalog/worldwide/websites/en_ae/product/qc35_ii.html) headphones which were great, but just getting old and worn.
