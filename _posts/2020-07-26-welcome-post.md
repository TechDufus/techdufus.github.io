# Well, here it is... My first Blog post ever ever... Ever! 

I've been pretty hesitant as to whether I thought it was worth the time and effort to post anything out on the interwebs, but here I am going for it. 

I just had a son, my wife just finished her Masters degree, and I... am trying to blog. My plan is to post content about PowerShell, the things that I've learned so far and the rest as I continue to learn and improve. If there are any non-powershell posts don't be suprised, PowerShell is just the initial plan. There are many more things I'm wanting to learn like C#, Docker, Salt, Ansible, Terraform, and the list goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on an<*OKAY ENOUGH OF THAT*!> :)

I want to keep this first post brief and just say hello! Feel free to check me out on [Github]('https://github.com/matthewjdegarmo'), where I will start posting some of the PowerShell work I've done, [Twitter]('https://www.twitter.com/matthewjdegarmo'), [LinkedIn]('https://linkedin.com/in/matthewjdegarmo'), or any other site I'm on! Please don't be afraid to say hello!
